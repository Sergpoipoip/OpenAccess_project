# Cultural heritage and tourism: impact on local economies

## 1. Introduction

In recent years, Italy's cultural heritage and tourism industry have become central topics of discussion, both nationally and internationally. Italy's rich cultural heritage is globally renowned, attracting millions of visitors each year. From UNESCO World Heritage Sites to local historical landmarks, cultural assets play a significant role in shaping tourism and, by extension, local economies. However, the economic and social impact of this cultural wealth varies significantly across different regions of the country. While some regions, such as Tuscany and Lazio, have successfully leveraged their cultural assets to drive tourism and economic growth, others struggle to fully capitalize on their potential.

The Italian economy, particularly in the post-pandemic era, has faced challenges in revitalizing its tourism sector, which is a key driver of employment and regional development ([ResearchGate]https://www.researchgate.net/publication/352268393_Post-pandemic_tourism_resilience_changes_in_Italians%27_travel_behavior_and_the_possible_responses_of_tourist_cities). At the same time, disparities in economic performance, employment rates, and income levels persist across regions ([OECD](https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/job-creation-and-local-economic-development-2024-country-notes_ad2806c1-en/italy_9a583862-en.html)), raising questions about the role of cultural heritage in fostering sustainable economic growth.

In this context, three key questions arise:
1. How does the presence of cultural heritage sites impact tourism activity and economic performance in different Italian regions?
2. Are regions with a higher concentration of cultural heritage sites better positioned to achieve economic resilience and growth?
3. What strategies can local governments use to leverage cultural heritage for economic growth?

This project aims to explore these questions by analyzing economic and employment data across different Italian regions. By comparing GDP, tourism revenue, employment indicators and regions with varying levels of cultural assets, the project seeks to uncover patterns and trends that can inform policy decisions and promote sustainable development.

The project aligns data from multiple sources, including:
- Cultural heritage data (e.g., museums, historical sites) from MiBACT and Europeana,
- Tourism data (e.g., tourist arrivals, nights spent) from Eurostat and ISTAT,
- Economic data (e.g., regional GDP, employment rates, income levels) from ISTAT, Eurostat, and the Bank of Italy.

The ultimate goal is to create an explorable map and visualizations that allow users to compare tourism activity, economic performance, and cultural heritage across Italian regions. By doing so, the project aims to highlight the economic potential of cultural heritage and provide actionable insights for policymakers, tourism boards, and local communities.

## 2. Application Scenario

This project aligns data from different sources to explore the relationship between cultural heritage, tourism, and economic development across Italian regions. By analyzing regional GDP, employment levels, tourism revenues, and household income, we aim to determine how cultural heritage contributes to local economies and whether regional disparities exist in its economic impact.

In particular, we investigate:

The correlation between the presence of cultural heritage sites and tourism revenues – Do regions with a higher density of cultural landmarks generate significantly more income from tourism?
The impact of cultural heritage on employment and income levels – Does tourism-driven economic activity lead to higher employment rates and better income distribution in culturally rich regions?
Policy strategies for leveraging cultural heritage – What approaches have been most effective in enhancing the economic benefits of cultural assets?

The findings of this project can be valuable for policymakers, local governments, tourism boards, and cultural institutions seeking to optimize the economic benefits of cultural heritage.
Policymakers can use the insights to design regional economic strategies that enhance the role of cultural heritage in employment and income growth. Local governments can identify underperforming regions where cultural assets remain an untapped economic resource and implement initiatives to strengthen their impact on tourism-driven development. At the same time, tourism boards can refine their promotional strategies by focusing on regions with high cultural value but lower economic returns, ensuring a more balanced distribution of tourism benefits. Finally, cultural institutions can leverage the data to advocate for increased funding, demonstrating their contribution not only to cultural preservation but also to regional prosperity.
By providing data-driven insights, this project aims to support sustainable economic growth and promote more balanced regional development through better utilization of Italy’s cultural heritage.
